DropboxDemo
===========

Using Maven, Eclipse, Tomcat 6 and Jersey 2 to create a Dropbox Java Web Application...

Install
===========
1) Install Tomcat 6.0

Note: Newer versions of Tomcat have been tried and failed. You might be able to get it to work, but I wouldn't bother.

2) Add a new Server in Eclipse for Tomcat 6.0

3) Download Repository

4) Import the project in Eclipse

5) Maven -> Install

6) Run As -> Run on Server

7) Navigate to http://localhost:8080/DropboxDemo/dropbox

Note: It will launch http://localhost:8080/DropboxDemo by default, not DropboxDemo/dropbox
